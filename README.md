# Sleep-Disorder-Analysis-Using-Power-BI
INTRODUCTION:
This is a health dataset which is publicly available and was downloaded from Kaggle.com
This analysis interactive dashboard (with slicers) was done with Business Intelligence (Power BI).

OBJECTIVES:
1.	Explore Sleep Duration, Sleep Quality and factors influencing Sleep Patterns
2.	Analyze Physical Activity Levels, Stress Level and BMI Categories.
3.	Examine Blood Pressure and Heartrate of Patients
4.	Identify the occurrence of sleep disorder.

KEY FINDINGS:
A total of 374 patients were accessed resulting to about 155 individuals (76 Sleep Apnea and 78 Insomnia) suffering from Sleep Disorder at a rate of 41% and 219 are free from Sleep Disorder.
It was observed that those with Optimal Sleep Duration had the least rate of Sleep Disorder at 14% while those with short Sleep Duration had about 54% rate of Sleep Disorder.
Sleep Disorder rate was high among patients with Very Poor Sleep Quality which was about 100% followed by Poor Sleep Quality (56%) and those who had Good and Fair Sleep Quality suffered less.
Across all four (4) Age Range (27-34, 35-42, 51-59, 43-50) SD Rate ranged from 12% to 80% with Age Range of 43-50 and 51-59 being affected more.
Across the various Occupation, at 100% Sales Representatives had the highest Sleep Disorder rate and was infinity higher than Manager which had the lowest Sleep Disorder rate of 0%.
It was equally observed that those with Low Physical Activity suffered the highest rate of Sleep Disorder of 78% and Moderate Physical Activity individuals had the lowest of 11%.
Individuals with High Stress Level suffered more from Sleep Disorder of 70% and Moderate Stress had the least at 12%.
Across the various Body Mass Index (BMI) categories Obese individuals suffered the highest rate of Sleep Disorder of 100% followed by Overweight of 87%, individuals with Normal Weight had 6% rate of Sleep Disorder 
Patients with Hyper2 and Hyper1 Blood Pressure suffered more Sleep Disorder at the rate of 93% and 59% respectively. While those with Normal Blood Pressure had 5%.
Patients with Elevated Heart Rate had the highest sleep this order issue which was 100%, 

Recommendation
Based on the findings regarding sleep disorders among the patient population, the following recommendations are proposed:
1.	Targeted Interventions for High-Risk Groups: Implement focused health interventions for individuals identified as high risk for sleep disorders, particularly those in the age ranges of 43-50 and 51-59, as well as patients with obesity, elevated heart rates, and high blood pressure.
2.	Promotion of Optimal Sleep Hygiene: Educate patients on the importance of optimal sleep duration and quality. Programs should focus on improving sleep hygiene practices, particularly for those currently experiencing short sleep duration and poor sleep quality.
3.	Physical Activity Initiatives: Encourage physical activity among patients, as those with low physical activity levels exhibit a significantly higher rate of sleep disorders. Community fitness programs or partnerships with local gyms could be beneficial.
4.	Stress Management Programs: Develop and promote stress management programs to help individuals with high stress levels. Techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy should be incorporated into these programs.
5.	Occupational Health Assessments: Conduct assessments of sleep health among various occupational groups, particularly focusing on Sales Representatives, who showed a 100% rate of sleep disorders. Workplace wellness programs could help mitigate these issues.
6.	Regular Health Monitoring: Establish routine screenings for blood pressure and heart rate to identify at-risk individuals early. Patients with hypertension or elevated heart rates should receive targeted interventions to manage these conditions and their impact on sleep health.
By addressing these areas, healthcare providers can improve sleep health outcomes and overall well-being among the patient population.
